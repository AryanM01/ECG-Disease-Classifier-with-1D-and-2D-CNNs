# ECG-Disease-Classifier-with-1D-and-2D-CNNs
A deep learning-based approach for the detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using a combination of 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks. This project achieves high accuracy in classifying ECG signals into multiple categories, including normal and various arrhythmias, using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset.
